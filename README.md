# Glicko2: A Probabilistic Chess Rating Framework

This is the final project by [Ozan Adiguzel](https://github.com/Ozan147) and [Mert Ketenci](https://github.com/ketencimert) for [Machine Learning with Probabilistic Programming](http://www.proditus.com/mlpp2021) (Fall 2021) at Columbia University.

The goal of this project is to explore the Glicko2 rating system using Stan with a focus on inference methods. We fit the stochastic variance model described in (Glickman, 2001) using various inference algorithms.
